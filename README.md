# DESCRIPTION:
The project involves developing a simple arithmetic expression evaluator in C++. This evaluator is designed to parse and evaluate basic mathematical expressions that include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses. The goal is to create a program that correctly handles operator precedence and evaluates the expression according to standard mathematical rules.

Problem Overview
In this project, the primary challenge is designing a program that takes an arithmetic expression in string format, processes the expression, and computes the correct result. The challenge is to correctly handle operator precedence and parentheses. For example, multiplication and division operations have higher precedence than addition and subtraction, and expressions inside parentheses need to be evaluated first.

The program must:

Parse an arithmetic expression consisting of digits and operators.
Handle parentheses to evaluate expressions inside them first.
Correctly apply operator precedence to ensure proper evaluation order (e.g., multiplication and division before addition and subtraction).
Provide the correct result for valid expressions.
Handle errors such as division by zero.
Key Design Concepts
The project revolves around basic parsing techniques commonly used in compilers. The main concepts incorporated into this design are:

Tokenization: The first step in parsing an arithmetic expression involves breaking the expression down into tokens. Tokens can be numbers, operators, or parentheses.

Operator Precedence: The evaluator needs to respect the precedence of operators (multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction). This requires a systematic approach to evaluating the operators in the correct order.

Parentheses Handling: Expressions enclosed in parentheses should be evaluated first. The evaluator must correctly handle nested parentheses and evaluate the innermost expressions first before moving outward.

Expression Evaluation: The actual evaluation of the expression involves performing the arithmetic operations in the correct order, taking operator precedence and parentheses into account.

Program Components
The core of the program is based on a stack-based approach, which is common in the evaluation of expressions. Here's an overview of the components:

Tokenization: The program processes the input expression character by character. Whenever a number is encountered, it is fully parsed, and the program continues to the next character. Operators and parentheses are processed separately.

Operator Precedence Management: To handle operator precedence, the program uses a stack to store operators. It checks whether the operator at the top of the stack has higher or equal precedence than the current operator and applies operations accordingly.

Parentheses Management: Parentheses are handled by pushing an opening parenthesis onto the stack when encountered. When a closing parenthesis is found, the program pops operators from the stack and evaluates them until an opening parenthesis is encountered.

Arithmetic Operations: Arithmetic operations are performed using basic conditional logic. For each operator, the program performs the corresponding operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) on the operands.

Steps in the Expression Evaluation Process
Parsing the Expression: The program begins by reading the input expression and processing it character by character. Numbers are collected and stored, while operators and parentheses are directly handled.

Handling Parentheses: If an opening parenthesis is encountered, the program recognizes that a new sub-expression begins. The program continues parsing until it reaches the corresponding closing parenthesis, which signals the end of the sub-expression. The sub-expression is then evaluated before continuing with the main expression.

Applying Operator Precedence: When encountering an operator, the program checks whether there are operators already on the stack. If the top operator on the stack has higher or equal precedence, the program applies the top operator before pushing the current operator onto the stack.

Evaluating the Expression: Once all tokens are processed, and all operations are applied, the program evaluates the expression by executing the arithmetic operations in the correct order. The result is returned and displayed.

Handling Errors: The program also includes error handling, particularly for division by zero. If a division by zero is detected, an exception is thrown, and an error message is displayed to the user.

Error Handling and Edge Cases
The program is designed to handle basic arithmetic expressions but also includes basic error handling for:

Invalid Expressions: The program is not capable of handling all invalid expressions (such as 3 + + 4), but it handles common errors like division by zero.
Division by Zero: The program explicitly checks for division by zero and raises an exception if it occurs.
Example Workflow
Consider the expression 3 + 5 * (2 + 8). Here's how the program would process it:

The program first evaluates the sub-expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 8 = 10.
It then multiplies the result by 5: 5 * 10 = 50.
Finally, it adds 3 to the result: 3 + 50 = 53.
The program correctly applies the order of operations and computes the result.

Conclusion
This project is a simple implementation of an arithmetic expression evaluator, which is a fundamental concept in the design of compilers. The program parses arithmetic expressions, handles operator precedence, processes parentheses, and performs arithmetic operations. The solution demonstrates basic concepts like tokenization, operator precedence, and error handling, making it a great introduction to parsing and expression evaluation. The program is designed to handle common cases and can be extended to manage more complex expressions and error scenarios.
